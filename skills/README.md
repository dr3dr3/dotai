# Agent Skills

A collection of agent skills that extend capabilities across planning, development, and tooling.

## Planning & Design

These skills help you think through problems before writing code.

- **write-a-prd** — Create a PRD through an interactive interview, codebase exploration, and module design. Filed as a GitHub issue.
- **prd-to-issues** — Break a PRD into independently-grabbable GitHub issues using vertical slices.
- **grill-me** — Get relentlessly interviewed about a plan or design until every branch of the decision tree is resolved.

## Development

These skills help you write, refactor, and fix code.

- **tdd** — Test-driven development with a red-green-refactor loop. Builds features or fixes bugs one vertical slice at a time.
- **triage-issue** — Investigate a bug by exploring the codebase, identify the root cause, and file a GitHub issue with a TDD-based fix plan.
- **improve-codebase-architecture** — Explore a codebase for architectural improvement opportunities, focusing on deepening shallow modules and improving testability.

## Tooling & Setup

- **setup-pre-commit** — Set up Husky pre-commit hooks with lint-staged, Prettier, type checking, and tests.
- **git-guardrails-claude-code** — Set up Claude Code hooks to block dangerous git commands (push, reset --hard, clean, etc.) before they execute.

## Communication

- **agent-email** — Send and receive email *as the agent* via AgentMail (`agent@rockofeye.net`). Human-in-the-loop only: draft → review → `--confirm` send, hard recipient allowlist, secret redaction, audit trail. Personal to André.

## Writing Skills

- **write-a-skill** — Create new skills with proper structure, progressive disclosure, and bundled resources.
